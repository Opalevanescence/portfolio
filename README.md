# Personal Website for Opalevanescence

This website can be accessed at [https://www.jessicaadewitt.com/](https://www.jessicaadewitt.com/). The portfolio houses specific web dev projects and writing samples that I'm proud of, gives some information about my professional skills, and provides a contact form.

This is a rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team and just works form a seed file because of the limited information displayed.
