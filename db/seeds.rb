  idea: "Every August, Edinburgh plays host to the magnificent Fringe, the worldâ€™s largest arts festival and most ticketed event after the Olympics. 1000s of shows are performed around the clock, ranging from comedy to cabaret, circus, theatre, dance and more! You are thoroughly spoilt for choice but the down side is the Herculean effort it takes to plan your festival experience. Fringe-goers are known to painstakingly construct monstrous, heavily formatted spreadsheets that scroll for miles with dozens of shortlisted shows and puzzle-pieced schedules! <br> MyFringePlanner makes organizing your Fringe experience fast, easy, and intuitive. It takes the pain out of complex organizing for individuals and groups.",
  tools: "This was coded using a Ruby on Rails framework. There is a little bit of AJAX used to load pages the way we want. The acts-as-follower gem is used to create relationships between users who are friends and between users and their favorited shows /n The 'friends' feature is actually still in the creation stages as is the 'Group' feature that will allow users to create shortlists and planners with a group of friends instead of just as an individual.",

  idea: "The idea was to create a site with similar functionalities to AirBnB, but with a twist to make it interesting and unique. Our unique approach was to make a marketplace for plants instead of rooms and houses. However, we intentially did not add a way for people to exchange money for plants as we don't intend to maintain this website.",
  tools: "This Ruby on Rails based website is hosted by Heroku and uses Cloudinary to store and manage its images. The site updates in real time as purchases are made or plants are posted. Most of the front end is done using Bootstrap rather than CSS.",

Hopefully you like what you see and as I continue to develop more skills I will be able to use them to improve and continue developing this site.",
  tools: "This site is made with Ruby on Rails and styled with SCSS. Simple Contact Form is used for the contact page and all the projects are from a PostgreSQL (not hardcoded). I originially created the design for the site on Figma before implementing it with code.",
